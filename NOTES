o There needs to be a way to specify the input and output line names
  instead of having to write garbage like:

        - con5 - frac[input0]

  when it should at the very least be

        - con5 - frac[dividend]

  Question: does this *define* the name of the connection?  I don't
  think so because each handler assigns certain semantics to
  particular names.  For example the divider has inputs named dividend
  and divisor and they are not the same!  So to use the component you
  have to now the port names and their meanings.

  In some cases you may not care which port you use, as for example
  with

        - in - add - out

  where we don't care which input port is used (addend0 or addend1 I
  guess) and there is only one output port.

o Need an abbreviation for

        - con5 - frac[input0]
        - frac[output0] - mul

  Presumably:

        - con5 - frac[input0,output0] - mul

  will do.  When the component has only one input or one output we can
  omit the unambiguous one:

        - con5 - frac[input0] - mul

  This could be ambiguous is there is both an input port named input0
  and a unique output port also named input0.  I thought this wasn't a
  big deal until I started to combine this with the previous section
  where you are _also_ allowed to omit the port name if you don't care
  which one.  But there is still only a problem if the `input0` can be
  understood as both an input and an output port, which I am willing
  to disregard.

  But to do all this there needs to be some way for the parser to
  query the component about what its port names are.

o More generally, components need a better API.
